This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C code when accessing array elements.  The bug.c file contains the erroneous code, attempting to access an array element beyond its defined bounds. The bugSolution.c file provides the corrected code, illustrating how to avoid this error.  This is a simple yet crucial example to illustrate the importance of careful array indexing in C programming to prevent unexpected crashes or data corruption.
